# Foodcamp

![screenshot](./app_screenshot.png)

The goal of this project is to create a food ordering website that lets users choose one item per category for a total of 3 items. As requested, no attention was given to the desktop version of the website, hence the odd-looking layout and scrollbars.
To achieve this, the project makes use of HTML5, CSS3, and vanilla JavaScript.
